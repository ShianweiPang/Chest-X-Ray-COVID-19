# Chest-X-Ray-Covid-19
### _WID3008 Image Processing_

Deep learning approaches are widely used to classify positivity of COVID-19 using Chest X-Ray images as it provides promising results with an extended accuracy. We proposed transfer learning using Convolutional Neural Network models. The models that I am using is MobileNetV2, ResNet50, DenseNet169 and Xception which supported by sklearn library to train and testing on the dataset which consists of 3 classes, which are COVID-19, Normal and Lung Opacity.

## Objectives
- classify the patients intro corresponding classes using their chest x-ray images
- evaluate and analyze the accuracy of classification of the best model chosen using appropriate evaluation metrics

## How to use the Python Notebooks/ Implementation
 - download the notebook locally and open using Jupyter notebook
 - open the notebook with Google Colab

## Results
For ResNet50
